# Optimizing CNN for RCC Detection

This project focuses on optimizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the **early detection of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)**. It classifies images to detect the presence of RCC cancer, but does not distinguish between its variants.

## 🧠 Objective

To build a deep learning model using CNN that effectively detects RCC from image data with high accuracy and optimized performance.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle RCC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- The dataset contains labeled histopathological images of RCC and non-cancerous kidney tissue.

## 🛠️ Features

- CNN-based architecture optimized through tuning layers and hyperparameters
- Image preprocessing techniques for enhanced accuracy
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
https://github.com/22BAI71168nikita/Optimizing_CNN_for_RCC.git

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Download and place the dataset from Kaggle in the appropriate folder.

## ▶️ Usage

Run the model script:
python cnn_model.py


Adjust model parameters in the script as needed.

## 📈 Results

- Achieved high detection accuracy on RCC vs. non-RCC image classification.
- Optimized model showed improved training stability and generalization.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Extend model to classify RCC subtypes.
- Deploy model as a web app or integrate into a diagnostic platform.
